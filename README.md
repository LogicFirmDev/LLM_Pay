# AI-Powered Payment Agent System

This repository contains a scaffolded implementation of an AI-powered payment platform built for the Stellar blockchain. The project is designed to combine autonomous payment agents, Stellar network integration, and a simple frontend dashboard into a modular architecture.

## Overview

The AI-Powered Payment Agent System is intended to showcase a clean project structure for:

- backend API services that manage payment workflows
- a frontend dashboard for monitoring wallets, transactions, and AI insights
- a Stellar-focused smart contract layer for transaction orchestration and validation

The current project is a scaffold only: it contains the structure and placeholders required to develop a full solution, but it does not implement actual payment, AI, or business logic.

## Objectives

- Automate payment workflows using AI-like agents
- Enable fast, low-cost transactions via the Stellar network
- Reduce fraud and transaction errors through validation
- Support cross-border payments with multi-currency capabilities
- Provide a developer-friendly dashboard and integration structure

## Architecture

The scaffold is organized into three main modules:

1. `backend/`
   - Express-based API server
   - Payment route placeholders
   - Stellar service and configuration stubs
2. `frontend/`
   - Vite + React application
   - Dashboard and payment UI stubs
   - API client placeholder for backend communication
3. `smart-contracts/`
   - Minimal Stellar SDK project
   - Entry point and contract-style placeholder modules
   - Validation and agent placeholders

## Folder Structure

- `/backend`
  - `package.json` - backend dependencies and scripts
  - `src/app.js` - Express application entry point
  - `src/routes/payments.js` - payment API routes
  - `src/controllers/paymentsController.js` - controller stubs
  - `src/services/stellarService.js` - Stellar integration placeholder
  - `src/config/index.js` - environment configuration

- `/frontend`
  - `package.json` - frontend dependencies and scripts
  - `vite.config.js` - Vite configuration
  - `index.html` - app shell
  - `src/main.jsx` - React entry point
  - `src/App.jsx` - main application component
  - `src/components/Dashboard.jsx` - dashboard placeholder
  - `src/components/PaymentForm.jsx` - payment form placeholder
  - `src/services/api.js` - backend API client stub

- `/smart-contracts`
  - `package.json` - Stellar SDK package manifest
  - `README.md` - smart contract folder documentation
  - `src/index.js` - baseline Stellar exports and setup placeholder
  - `src/paymentAgent.js` - AI payment agent placeholder
  - `src/validationEngine.js` - validation engine placeholder

## Setup

### Backend

1. Navigate to `backend/`
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The backend listens on `http://localhost:4000` by default.

### Frontend

1. Navigate to `frontend/`
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend is configured to run on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Smart Contracts

1. Navigate to `smart-contracts/`
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd smart-contracts
   npm install
   ```
3. The package is intentionally minimal and does not include a runtime flow.

## How To Extend This Project

### Backend

- Add real payment and validation endpoints
- Implement Stellar transaction construction in `src/services/stellarService.js`
- Add security, authentication, and fraud detection logic
- Integrate AI agent decision-making with payment workflows

### Frontend

- Build wallet overview and transaction history screens
- Add form controls for payment creation and approval
- Consume backend endpoints using `src/services/api.js`
- Display AI insights, risk scores, and transaction statuses

### Smart Contracts / Stellar Layer

- Use `stellar-sdk` to create and sign transactions
- Define asset support, multi-currency transfers, and trustline rules
- Build validation flows in `src/validationEngine.js`
- Implement agent orchestration in `src/paymentAgent.js`

## Notes

- Stellar does not use traditional smart contracts in the same way as EVM blockchains. The `smart-contracts/` folder is therefore built as a logical Stellar integration layer rather than a classical contract repository.
- This scaffold serves as a starting point for building a production-ready system.

## Next Steps

- Define the payment workflow requirements and business rules
- Wire the backend routes to the frontend UI
- Add Stellar account management, funding, and transaction signing
- Add AI agent modules for risk scoring and decision automation
